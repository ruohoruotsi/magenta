  The general strategy employed is to first check if there are places in the
  sustained pianoroll where no notes are active within the max_length window;
  if so the middle of the last gap is chosen as the split point.

  If not, then it checks if there are places in the pianoroll without sustain
  where no notes are active and then finds last zero crossing of the wav file
  and chooses that as the split point.

  If neither of those is true, then it chooses the last zero crossing within
  the max_length window as the split point.

  If there are no zero crossings in the entire window, then it basically gives
  up and advances time forward by max_length.

  Args:
      note_sequence: The NoteSequence to split.
      samples: The audio file as samples.
      sample_rate: The sample rate (samples/second) of the audio file.
      min_length: Minimum number of seconds in a split.
